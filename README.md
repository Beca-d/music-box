## Description

This webpage was built to give music fans a hub to search their favourite artists and be returned with those artists top ten tracks, the lyrics for each of those songs and a song demo as well as a link to listen to the whole song in a new tab. The users previous searches will also be stored for them to view again and an easy function for copying lyrics has also been added to improve the user experience.
